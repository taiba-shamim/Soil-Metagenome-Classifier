# AI-Based Taxonomic Classification of Soil Metagenome

An alignment-free, machine learning pipeline for species-level taxonomic 
classification of soil bacterial metagenomic fragments using canonical 
k-mer frequency profiles and gradient boosting.

---

## Overview

Soil microbiomes harbour extraordinary taxonomic diversity, with a single 
gram containing up to 10⁹ bacterial cells representing thousands of species. 
Conventional alignment-based classifiers such as BLAST and Kraken2 depend 
heavily on reference database completeness and impose substantial 
computational overhead, limiting their applicability to large, complex soil 
datasets.

This project develops an **alignment-free**, **machine learning-driven** 
pipeline that classifies short metagenomic DNA fragments to species level 
using canonical hexanucleotide (6-mer) frequency profiles and an XGBoost 
gradient boosting model.

## Pipeline


<img width="1280" height="720" alt="pipeline-overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8776a5e6-cf81-449d-b8cd-105285fdb6a0" />

The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Reference genome curation** — 306 soil-associated bacterial species from NCBI RefSeq
2. **Genome fragmentation** — simulating short-read sequencing
3. **Canonical k-mer extraction** — 2,080-dimensional feature vectors
4. **Label encoding** — bijective species-to-integer mapping
5. **Model training** — XGBoost classifier on 93.8M fragments
6. **Internal evaluation** — held-out test set of 52.4M fragments
7. **External validation** — CAMISIM-simulated metagenomic communities

## Methodology

### Data

Reference genomes for **306 soil-associated bacterial species** were 
retrieved from the NCBI RefSeq database. The full species list is 
available in `species_list.txt`.

### Feature Representation

Each DNA fragment is encoded as a normalised **2,080-dimensional canonical 
6-mer frequency vector**. Canonical k-mers reduce the feature space from 
4⁶ = 4,096 possible 6-mers to 2,080 by collapsing reverse complements, 
exploiting DNA strand symmetry.

### Model

An **XGBoost gradient boosting classifier** was selected for its scalability, 
implicit feature selection, and demonstrated performance on high-dimensional 
sparse data. Hyperparameters were tuned via grid search with early stopping. 
Training was parallelised across 32 cores on a high-performance computing 
cluster.

### Validation

- **Internal:** held-out test set of 52.4M fragments from disjoint genomes
- **External:** CAMISIM-simulated metagenomic communities across 10 species

## Usage

The pipeline is organised as sequential stages. Run them in order:

```bash
# 1. Fragment reference genomes
cd fragments && python fragment_train.py && python fragment_test.py

# 2. Extract canonical k-mers
cd ../kmers && python kmerize.py

# 3. Encode species labels
cd ../label_encoding && python label_encoder.py

# 4. Train the model
cd ../model_train && python train_xgboost.py

# 5. Validate on CAMISIM simulations
cd ../CAMISIM-validation && bash run_camisim.sh
```
